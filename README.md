# gtda-challenge-2020

## Introduction
Welcome to the Giotto-tda use-cases challenge 2020. The purpose of this challenge is to create the best use-case of applied topology of the year! In order to participate to this challenge and have a chance to win, you have to submit a Jupyter Notebook to this repo (see [the section below](#submission-procedure)) with the following structure:
1. Introduction, i.e. where the problem is explained
2. Dataset, i.e. where the dataset is described
3. Analysis, i.e. where the steps of the analysis are highlighted and the central role played by Giotto-tda is explained
4. Short benchmark with comparable non-topological methods
Please see the [example_notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/giotto-ai/gtda-challenge-2020/example/example_notebook.ipynb) in the */example* folder.

## A few rules
1. There are no constraints on the data type to be used. 
2. The dataset has to be public or publishable
3. [Giotto-tda](https://github.com/giotto-ai/giotto-tda) has to play a central role in tha analysis

## Submission procedure
1. The first step is to clone this repository
2. In the root folder of the cloned repository, create a new folder with your team leader name (it is advisable if it coincides with the github name of the team leader)
3. The unique Jupyter notebook with the usecase has to be named **main.ipynb**; the dataset and the auxilirary Python files (if needed) are also to be put in the same folder. Datasets can also be directly imported from external URLs or from data sharing platforms such as [OpenML](https://www.openml.org).

### Deadline
The PR submission date and hour will have to take place before the 30th of October 2020 at 23:59 [CET](https://time.is/CET).

## Winner announcement and prizes
On the 9th of November the evaluation phase will end and the first three winners will be announced. A [Condorcet method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method) will be used to preapre the classification. 
The prizes will be the following:
1. for the winner, 2000CHF
2. for the second, 1000CHF
